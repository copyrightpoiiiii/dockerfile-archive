# This health check was added for Docker Hub automated test service. Parameters
# were changed in order to mark success faster. You may want to change these
# further in production.
#
#
# By default, the Docker health check runs after 30s, and if a failure occurs,
# it waits 30s to try again. This implies a minimum of 30s before the server is
# marked healthy.
#
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck
#
# We expect the server startup to take less than 10 seconds, even in a fresh
# start. Some health checks will trigger a slow "first request" due to schema
# setup (ex this is the case in Elasticsearch and Cassandra). However, we don't
# want to force an initial delay of 30s as defaults would.
#
# Instead, we lower the interval and timeout from 30s to 5s. If a server starts
# in 7s and takes another 2s to install schema, it can still pass in 10s vs 30s.
#
# We retain the 30s even if it would be an excessively long startup. This is to
# accomodate test containers, which can boot slower than production sites, and
# any knock-on effects of that, like slow dependent storage containers which are
# simultaneously bootstrapping. If in production, you have a 30s startup, please
# report to https://gitter.im/openzipkin/zipkin including the values of the
# /health and /info endpoints as this would be unexpected.
