# Title:            Mac on Docker (Docker-OSX) [VNC EDITION]
# Author:           Sick.Codes https://sick.codes/

# 
# This Dockerfile automates the installation of Docker-OSX
# It will build a 32GB Mojave Disk, you can change the size using build arguments.
# This file builds on top of the work done by Dhiru Kholia and many others.
#       
#
# Build:
#
#       # write down the password at the end
#       docker build -t docker-osx-vnc .
# 
# Run:
#       
#       docker run -p 8888:5999 -d --privileged docker-osx-vnc:latest
#
#
# Connect locally (safe):
#
#       VNC Host:     localhost:8888
#
#
# Connect remotely (safe):
#
#
#       # Open a terminal and make an SSH tunnel on port 8888 to your server
#       ssh -N root@111.222.33.44 -L  8888:127.0.0.1:8888
#       
#       # now you can connect like a local
#       VNC Host:     localhost:8888
#
#
# Connect remotely (unsafe):
#
#       VNC Host:     remotehost:8888
#
#
# Security:
#
#       - Think what would happen if someone was in your App Store.
#       - Keep port 8888 closed to external internet traffic, allow local IP's only.
#       - All traffic is insecurely transmitted in plain text, try to use an SSH tunnel.
#       - Everything you write can be sniffed along the way.
#       - VNC Password is only 8 characters.
#
# Show VNC password again:
#
#       docker ps
#       # copy container ID and then 
#       docker exec abc123fgh456 tail vncpasswd_file
# 
# 
# Optional:
#       
#       You can set VNC color depth with -e DEPTH=24, it's not pretty though.
#

# Let's piggyback the other image:
